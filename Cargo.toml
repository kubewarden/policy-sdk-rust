# Starting from k8s-openapi v0.14, it is NOT recommended to be explicit about
# the kubernetes features to be used when building a library. That's because
# the final version of the k8s API to be supported must be made by the consumer
# of the library.
#
# Otherwise it's possible to end up in situations like:
# * kubewarden-policy-sdk enables the `v1_22` feature of k8s-openapi
# * `consumer-foo` requires k8s-openapi too but enables the `v1_23` feature
# A build error is then raised by cargo because the same version must be picked
# by all the crates making use of k8s-openapi.
#
# Because of that, no feature is chosen inside of the `dependencies` section.
# This however can lead to issues when executing commands like
# cargo `build|check|doc`. That's because the `k8s-openapi` is specified again
# inside of the `dev-dependencies`, this time with a k8s feature enabled
